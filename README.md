 **Linked Lists – Python Implementations**

This repository contains multiple Python implementations of different types of linked lists, along with supportive images that illustrate how linked lists work in memory. The goal of this project is to provide clear, educational examples of linked list data structures for learners, students, and anyone revisiting data structure fundamentals.

## **🧠 What’s Included**

### **1. Basic Singly Linked List Implementation**

A simple, beginner-friendly Python file demonstrating:

* Node creation
* Insertion (head, tail)
* Deletion
* Traversal
* Searching

Useful for understanding how linked lists work at the most fundamental level.

---

### **2. Doubly Linked List Implementation**

This file shows how to implement:

* Nodes with both `next` and `prev` pointers
* Forward and backward traversal
* Insert and delete operations at various positions

Doubly linked lists allow bidirectional movement through the data.

---

### **3. Circular Singly Linked List Implementation**

A circular version of a singly linked list where:

* The last node points back to the head
* Useful for applications like round-robin scheduling

This file includes operations like insertion, deletion, and circular traversal.

---

### **4. Circular Doubly Linked List Implementation**

The most flexible list type in this repository:

* Nodes link both forward and backward
* The last node loops back to the head
* Excellent for implementing cyclic data structures

## **🖼️ Images Included**

Several images are included to help visualize linked list concepts:

* **arraysvslinkedlists.png** – Comparisons between arrays and linked lists
* **Definition.png** – What a linked list is
* **MemoryAdress.png** – How pointers and memory references work
* **Linked lists in memory.jpg** – Visual representation of linked lists stored in memory

These visuals can be used in documentation, teaching, or presentations.

---

## **🚀 How to Run the Code**

All implementations use pure Python and require no external libraries.

```bash
python filename.py
```

Replace `filename.py` with the linked list implementation you want to run.

---

## **📚 Learning Goals**

* Understand node-based data structures
* Learn how pointers/references work in Python
* Practice implementing classic linked-list operations
* Study differences between various types of linked lists

---

## **🤝 Contributions**

You can add:

* More linked list variations
* Unit tests
* Performance comparisons
* Visualizations or GIF demos
